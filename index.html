    <h2 class="description">Nagpur, often called the Orange City of India, is the third-largest city in Maharashtra and a key commercial and political center in central India. It is famous for producing some of the best-quality oranges in the country, contributing significantly to India’s agricultural exports. The city holds historical and geographical importance as the Zero Mile City, marking the geographical center of India. With a strong transportation network, including Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar International Airport, major railway junctions, and a rapidly expanding metro system, Nagpur is emerging as a smart city with growing urban infrastructure and connectivity.</h2>

    <h2 class="description">The city has a rich cultural and historical heritage, with deep ties to the Buddhist movement and the Maratha Empire. One of its most important landmarks is Deekshabhoomi, where Dr. B.R. Ambedkar and his followers embraced Buddhism, making it a major pilgrimage site. Nagpur is also home to Sitabuldi Fort, which played a crucial role in India’s freedom struggle. The city's vibrant cultural scene includes grand celebrations of Ganesh Chaturthi, Dussehra, and Diwali, attracting visitors from across India. Additionally, Nagpur has several well-known temples, churches, and mosques, reflecting its diverse religious heritage.</h2>

    <h2 class="description">Nagpur is a gateway to some of India’s finest wildlife reserves, including the Pench Tiger Reserve, Tadoba National Park, and Umred Karhandla Wildlife Sanctuary. These reserves, rich in biodiversity, attract nature lovers and wildlife enthusiasts. The city itself has several beautiful green spaces like Futala Lake, Ambazari Lake, and Seminary Hills, providing a refreshing escape from urban life. With well-maintained gardens and lakes, Nagpur is often regarded as one of the greenest cities in India, contributing to a better quality of life for its residents.</h2>
